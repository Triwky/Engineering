            1/19/24 - This is my first journal of second semester. This week, we learned about chemical engineering and what they do. In short, they basically deal with all chemistry and molecular bonds for products. We also started a new project to create a car to do a certain task that we come up with. Me and my partner decided that we will replicate the MOOSE test which is a safety test for cars that determine if they can go around a moose without sliding or flipping over. We plan to put the battery on the bottom to keep the center of gravity low while putting the PCB above seperated by a piece of cardboard and wrap the entire underside plus wheels with a custom chassis made out of cardboard as just having some wheels with wire + motor + PCB + battery will not be the prettiest.

            1/26/24 - This week we started a project. This project consists of using an arduino and creating a car that will do a specific task that was defined by us. For our project, we are designing our car around the MOOSE test. Currently, we have created a CAD design that we are both in agreement (my teammate) and are finishing up the electronic CAD design.

            1/26/24 - Next week, we hope we can finish the electronic portion. By tuesday we hope that we can start designing a prototype with cardboard. We are still in designing phase for the MOOSE test itself.

            2/5/24 - Last week, we finished CADing and started the development of our chassis alongside the electronics. This week, our goal is to wire everything and atleast get a rolling chassis. We hope that by Friday that we can get that rolling chassis and finish the tinkering of the ARDUINO code. This weekend, I am not planning on doing anything. Rather, I'm going to do my Comp Sci HW.

            2/13/24 - This week, we finished our second prototype for chassis. We additionally got our wiring and coding mainly finished and are going to start the design of the chassis. This week, we will be, in addition to the chassis design, creating points to lessen the friction between motor and the chassis.

            1. Our final product was a tank with a turret ontop and two motors driving the car from the center. Additionally, there were wheels infront and behind the motors. In the final testing day, our car did alright. Our plan was for it to go around in circles and drive forward. However, the cars alignment was off and kept straying to the right and then turning left with the circle code.

            2. We could not measure our first prototype as the body fell apart as the walls were made as hinges. Our second car was not measured but went fairly far compared to the other cars in the competition.
        <br>
            3. Between our two cars, our second car did better. Our first car only featured two wheels in the back acting as rear-wheel drive like an actual car. Our second car was built with six wheels with two wheels attached to a motor within the middle. Our second car did better as the body did not fall apart when testing.

            4. If I were to make a third car, I would base it more upon a SUV and try to make the alignment straighter. Personally, I learned that working with cardboard requires careful planning and not a rushed job. Additionally, I learned that with little mass, the resistance is not that much when just using power to turn rather than steering to turn. ALSO, I learned that a hinge should not
               be made from cardboard as opening it 10 times made it worn out and deformed the car shape as the walls were hinges to open the body to access the electronics.
