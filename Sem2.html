            1/19/24 - This is my first journal of second semester. This week, we learned about chemical engineering and what they do. In short, they basically deal with all chemistry and molecular bonds for products. We also started a new project to create a car to do a certain task that we come up with. Me and my partner decided that we will replicate the MOOSE test which is a safety test for cars that determine if they can go around a moose without sliding or flipping over. We plan to put the battery on the bottom to keep the center of gravity low while putting the PCB above seperated by a piece of cardboard and wrap the entire underside plus wheels with a custom chassis made out of cardboard as just having some wheels with wire + motor + PCB + battery will not be the prettiest.
