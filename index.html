            8/20/23 - This is my first journal entry! 
            </p>
            8/25/23 - This week was eventful. I did a ton of homework alongside studying for AP Environmental Science. This week, I learned about the Engineering process alongside Binary, Hex Code, and Base 10 translations.
            Safety was also something I learned and how it is essential to this class. The challenge on Thursday involved PVC pipes and working as a team to move a marble from one place to another.
            My team managed to score while the other team failed every attempt. This weekend I am going to be studying for my classes alongside completing labs for AP Comp Sci.

            9/1/23 - During the last week of August of 2023, I learned about the engineering processes alongside safety processes. To be more specific, we learned about mechanical engineering and how it entails mathematical 
            and physics principles with the addition of simple machines. We also started designing Rube Goldberg Machine on Wednesday in our groups with Justin, Ian, and I being part of a team. Our class also held a household 
            appliances contest in which Mr. Poole gave the two winners two Kit Kats.

            9/8/23 - This week, everything was just mediocre. Every class went by relatively fast but still felt slow at the same time. I learned about mathematical processes in AP Comp Sci and how to construct and declare those with integers and doubles.

                    Our Rube Goldberg will first send down a ball into a pullee system and that pullee system will bring a car up to a platform to be sent down into a lever with a needle on it to poke the balloon into oblivion. All our machines in the machine
                    are screw, incline plane, pullee, wheel and axle, and a lever. 
                    I think the most challenging part of the machine will be the structural integrety of the cardboard structures as the baseball is relatively heay.
