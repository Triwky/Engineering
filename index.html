            8/25/23 - This week was eventful. I did a ton of homework alongside studying for AP Environmental Science. This week, I learned about the Engineering process alongside Binary, Hex Code, and Base 10 translations.
            Safety was also something I learned and how it is essential to this class. The challenge on Thursday involved PVC pipes and working as a team to move a marble from one place to another.
            My team managed to score while the other team failed every attempt. This weekend I am going to be studying for my classes alongside completing labs for AP Comp Sci.
