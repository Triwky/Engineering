            8/20/23 - This is my first journal entry! 
            </p>
            8/25/23 - This week was eventful. I did a ton of homework alongside studying for AP Environmental Science. This week, I learned about the Engineering process alongside Binary, Hex Code, and Base 10 translations.
            Safety was also something I learned and how it is essential to this class. The challenge on Thursday involved PVC pipes and working as a team to move a marble from one place to another.
            My team managed to score while the other team failed every attempt. This weekend I am going to be studying for my classes alongside completing labs for AP Comp Sci.

            9/1/23 - During the last week of August of 2023, I learned about the engineering processes alongside safety processes. We also started designing Rube Goldberg Machine on Wednesday while having a household appliances
            contest in which Mr. Poole gave the two winners two Kit Kats.
