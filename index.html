            8/20/23 - This is my first journal entry! 
            </p>
            8/25/23 - This week was eventful. I did a ton of homework alongside studying for AP Environmental Science. This week, I learned about the Engineering process alongside Binary, Hex Code, and Base 10 translations.
            Safety was also something I learned and how it is essential to this class. The challenge on Thursday involved PVC pipes and working as a team to move a marble from one place to another.
            My team managed to score while the other team failed every attempt. This weekend I am going to be studying for my classes alongside completing labs for AP Comp Sci.

            9/1/23 - During the last week of August of 2023, I learned about the engineering processes alongside safety processes. To be more specific, we learned about mechanical engineering and how it entails mathematical 
            and physics principles with the addition of simple machines. We also started designing Rube Goldberg Machine on Wednesday in our groups with Justin, Ian, and I being part of a team. Our class also held a household 
            appliances contest in which Mr. Poole gave the two winners two Kit Kats.
